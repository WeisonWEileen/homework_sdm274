### Project Title:
Machine Failure Prediction in Manufacturing: A Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Models

### Project Description:
In this project, students will apply their knowledge of linear regression, perceptron, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) to predict machine failures in a manufacturing setting. The project will utilize the "AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes data on machine failures with various process parameters. Students will perform data preprocessing and then build and compare different supervised learning models, including an MLP, for predicting machine failures.

### Project Requirements:

#### Dataset:
- Students will use the "AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 10,000 data points with 14 features, including various process parameters and a binary target variable indicating whether a machine failure occurred.
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset

#### Tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset and perform basic data cleaning to handle missing values and irrelevant features.
   - Normalize or standardize the features if necessary.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select or engineer features that could be relevant for predicting machine failures.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement linear regression, perceptron, and logistic regression models to predict machine failures.
   - Implement an MLP model to predict machine failures, using at least one hidden layer.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).
   - Train each model on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.
   - Use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, to evaluate the models.

5. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compare the performance of the different models.
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model in the context of predictive maintenance.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning for the perceptron, logistic regression, and MLP models to improve their performance.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Write a detailed report documenting the entire process, including data preprocessing, model implementation, results, and conclusions.
   - Include visualizations and charts to support the findings.

8. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare a presentation to showcase the project findings to the class.

### Deliverables:
- A Jupyter Notebook or a similar document containing the code, analysis, and results.
- A written report (PDF format) detailing the methodology, findings, and conclusions.
- A PowerPoint presentation (PPT format) for the class presentation.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Quality of data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Correct implementation of the machine learning models.
- Thoroughness of model evaluation and comparison.
- Clarity and organization of the written report and presentation.
- Creativity in model improvement and feature engineering.
- Effectiveness of communication in the presentation.

This project will provide students with hands-on experience in applying supervised learning models to a real-world engineering problem, specifically in the context of predictive maintenance, and will help them develop their skills in data analysis, model evaluation, and presentation. The inclusion of an MLP model will also allow students to explore the capabilities of neural networks in handling complex, non-linear relationships in data.
